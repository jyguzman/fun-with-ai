# Fun with AI

Fun with AI is a web application developed using
React and Typescript, and is deployed using theGoogle
Cloud Platform Application Engine.

You can enter any prompt you'd like, and the app will query the OpenAI Completions API to send you an AI-generated response to whatever prompt you type! 

The responses you receive are saved, so you can come back to them after refreshing or closing the browser. You can also choose from engines, which provide different AI capabilities.

Alternatively, you can download this repositry, open
a terminal in the root directory, and type and enter the command "npm start", which will open the application at http://localhost:3000.
